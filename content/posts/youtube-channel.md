## Dagger 2 Deep Dive
Currently there is a series that does a deep dive into Dagger 2, with the goal of truly understanding *how* it works, rather than just getting it set up to work and moving on.

## Future
I will likely be moving away from long, series-style videos and focus more on one-off topics that I've come across in my day-to-day job and/or side projects.

In case it isn't obvious, creating a series like that Dagger 2 deep-dive linked above is an incredibly time intensive process. I don't want to rule it out completely, but at this stage, while I still have a full-time Android development position, it isn't viable to complete these in a reasonable amount of time.
